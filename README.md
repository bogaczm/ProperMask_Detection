# Proper mask usage detection

This projects target is to create a real time mask detector. During pandemics it is very important to keep ourselves safe by keeping masks on.

<hr>

## The program is supposed to detect three classes:

1. Mask is on, everything is correct.
2. Mask is partially on, good for trying.
3. Mask is not on, you should put it now.
